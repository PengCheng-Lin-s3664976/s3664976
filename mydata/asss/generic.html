								<h2>Overview:</h2>
								<p>The combination of AR and 5G can significantly reduce the cost of AR glasses. All image clips and combinations can be processed through the cloud and then transmitted to each user to get the image they want. For example, previous AR devices were too bulky and required the necessary equipment to be installed on the glasses. However, with 5G transmission speeds, we can boldly take these devices apart and focus on one place to process image information. There are two advantages here: first, it is convenient. Every AR glasses can be moved to any position without any weight problems. Second, reducing costs allows more users to experience things they haven't experienced before. For example, virtual characters can be seen standing in front of them in a combination of virtual and reality.</p>
								<h2>Motivation: </h2>
								<p>In the past few years, through the observation of life, I found that most people began to rely on technology to live, leaving the most boring things to technology to liberate themselves. Thus, I wonder if there's a better way for people to search freely. When you meet something, you don't understand, or you see something you don't know, you will search for information on the Internet, but it's a waste of time. Furthermore, you have to put up with finding the answers you want from thousands of sources. This sounds like a very tedious process. For instance, the current mobile game Pokémon GO can be presented to us more naturally. The user can interact with Pokémon from a distance. Therefore, if this problem is solved, then the market is enormous.  </p>
								<h2>Description:</h2>
								<p>This product can be used for two types of users: business users and general users. First of all, enterprises can identify and track specific image targets and judge the target posture to achieve customized 3D advertising marketing effect rendering and achieve the purpose of precision marketing. For example, enterprises can accurately and efficiently identify and track user-defined image targets and realize the recognition of two-dimensional coordinates and three-dimensional posture of target images. Multi-image target recognition and tracking can be achieved simultaneously up to 15 goals can be tracked simultaneously. Secondly for ordinary users can be used to face recognition-based beauty makeup. For example, the user can perform face alignment and facial expression recognition, facial positioning, based on the user's facial expression and facial position, superposition beauty effect, automatic makeup, etc., can also superposition 2-d beauty and makeup props, such as animal ears, or 3-d dynamic special effects according to the user's facial expression and facial movement. By face recognition, 3D face texture recognition can fully match face contour and facial features and add cool effects such as the 3D facial mask.</p>
								<p>Based on visual perception technology, users can accurately perceive various environmental elements, such as geographical information, environmental plane, environmental contour, and environmental obstacles, to construct three-dimensional ecological maps. At the same time, users can add cool virtual 3D dynamic effects in the real environment by overlaying 3D objects on any scene and drawing virtual objects according to the environment perception map. For example, the user can perform face alignment and facial expression recognition, facial positioning, based on the user's facial expression and facial position, superposition beauty effect, automatic makeup, etc., can also superposition 2-d beauty and makeup props, such as animal ears, or 3-d dynamic special effects according to the user's facial expression and facial movement. From face recognition, 3D face texture recognition can fully match face contour and facial features and add cool effects such as the 3D facial mask. Besides, based on visual perception technology, users can accurately perceive various environmental elements, such as geographical information, environmental plane, environmental contour, and environmental obstacles, to construct three-dimensional ecological maps. At the same time, users can add cool virtual 3D dynamic effects in the real environment by overlaying 3D objects on any scene and drawing virtual objects according to the environment perception map.</p>
								<h2> Tools and Technologies：</h2>
								

								<p>Video real-time recording method and recording device based on augmented reality——It is a technology that superimposes computer-generated virtual information into the real scene, realizes the integration of virtual and real, and achieves the effect of augmented reality environment. Augmented reality includes three aspects :(1) the combination of the real and the virtual;(2) real-time interaction;(3) 3 d registration. Through the analysis and matching of scene object, the attitude information of camera in the real world is calculated according to the relevant data of projection, so as to realize the accurate addition of virtual model.</p>
								<h2>Skills Required：</h2>
								<p>	●PC - based 3d animation rendering and production software.3DmaxIts predecessor is 3D Studio series software based on DOS operating system.	</p>
								<p>	●Java is an object-oriented programming language. It not only absorbs the advantages of C++, but also abandons the concepts of multiple inheritance and pointer that are hard to understand in C++. Therefore, the Java language is characterized by powerful functions and easy to use.</p>	
								<p>	●Unity3D is a multi-platform integrated game development tool that enables players to easily create interactive contents such as 3d video games, architectural visualization, real-time 3d animation, etc., and is a comprehensive integrated professional game engine.</p>	
								<h2>Outcome:</h2>
							<p>In summary, if this project is realized, it will liberate everyone's hands. Because all you have to do is look at the object, you want to ask through an AR lens. There's no need to pull out your phone to take a picture or search for keywords to find it. Also, with the development of science and technology, this project is likely to replace mobile phones, which will further reduce the number of myopia.</p>
