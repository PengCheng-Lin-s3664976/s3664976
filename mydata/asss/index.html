											<h2>Personal Information</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My favorite sport is playing football. Because I am a Beckham fan, my room is full of pictures of Beckham. Football can enhance the ability of team communication. For example, in the game, each team member needs to be focused on communication to understand the overall situation of the team. In this way every player knows when he needs to help his teammates, and hopefully to win the game.

										<h3> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? 
											Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? 
											Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>
										<p>When I first learned about computers, I thought this was just for playing games. When I went to high school, someone recommended a trading software called Taobao and I realized that my vision was too narrow. After that, I thought of a lot of good ideas. For instance, study, video, and delivery of all kinds of applications. </p>

										<span class="icon major style3 fa-copy"></span>
										<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
										<p>During my last year of high school, I wanted to know more things about the computers because the computer is not just in China, it is global. Therefore, I considered which university to choose, and then I heard from others that the design at RMIT is great. If I study in this school, it may be easy to find a designer to help me design the website? I did a search on the Internet for the information technology ranking of this school, and the result was very high. So, I decided to study at RMIT.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style5 fa-diamond"></span>
										<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
										<p>First of all, I want to learn how to cooperate with teams here and improve my communication skills, because I can better communicate with the engineering team and solve problems quickly in future jobs. I also want to learn management skills, because it can improve the efficiency of a team. In terms of skills, I would like to learn how to program and management databases and other related skills.</p>

								<p >I want to be an IT operation engineer because this job involves a lot of skills. VMWare ESX, SolarWinds n-able and a few more. Besides, IT operation engineer job is easy to find in today's job market, because every company needs an IT operations engineer. This job requires an individual to have two years of work experience. And experience with network operating systems and hardware support, mainly Windows 2008, 2012, 2016, and VMWare ESX. IT operation engineer must also have logical thinking to manipulate events. Typically, tools like SolarWinds n-able and ConnectWise are used to save the document and implement and communicate the changes based on experience with the change and configuration management process. </p>
								<p >There are many skills I will need to learn. First, I need to learn how to do Excel, because every position requires a worker to be able to do Excel. I am currently able to use Java and SQL beginners. Therefore, it is not easy to find a job in the future. I need to keep learning new knowledge and consulting relevant expertise in the school holidays. Also, I will ask my friends or family related experienced people to help me learn relevant skills. Because my brother is an IT operation engineer, I can ask him some questions in his spare time, or I can find some free video through the Internet to learn relevant knowledge and skills.</p>
