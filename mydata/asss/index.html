										<p>My favorite sport is playing football,
											 whenever from the TV to see the athletes in the football field is so exciting, 
											every kind of spirit, natural and unrestrained, I am very envious, 
											gradually fell in love with playing football. 
											If you want to play football with me, you can contact me! Here is another interesting thing that happened to me with football.
											 When I was a child, saw a group of people chasing football on the green grass, 
											 and I thought it was very interesting, so I pointed to the TV and said to my parents, 
											 I want to play football. Maybe I am so addicted to playing football that I forget the time many times. 
											 So, every time my parents go on a business trip, 
											 they will entrust our neighbors to take care of me.
